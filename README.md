Hello everyone!
My name is Marco Alejandro Godoy Valdebenito, welcome to my personal website

I am PhD. candidate in mathematics under supervision of Daniel Barrera Salazar at Universidad de Santiago de Chile. My PhD. Thesis talks about the connection of non-torsion points of certain modular elliptic curves with the derivative of p-adic L-functions, in spirit of the Birch and Swinnerton Dyer conjecture.

Inside of my research interest, are Number Theory, Automorphic Forms, Complex Analysis and Abstract Algebra.
